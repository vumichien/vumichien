## My Animated Project Showcases âœ¨

This section showcases some of my projects using auto-generated animated SVGs!

The animations are generated by a GitHub Actions workflow and stored in the `dist/project-animations/` directory of this repository.

To add an animation to this README, you can use the following Markdown snippet. Make sure to replace `your-project-name-animation.svg` with the actual filename of the SVG you want to display from the `dist/project-animations/` folder.

**Example for a single animation:**

```markdown
![My Cool Project Animation](dist/project-animations/my-cool-project-animation.svg)
```
*Remember to replace `my-cool-project-animation.svg` with the actual filename. The filenames are typically based on your project names, e.g., `your-repo-name-animation.svg`.*

**To display multiple animations, you can list them:**

One simple way is to list them with headings for each project:

```markdown
### Project Alpha
![Project Alpha Animation](dist/project-animations/project-alpha-animation.svg)

### Project Beta
![Project Beta Animation](dist/project-animations/project-beta-animation.svg)

### Another Great Project
![Another Great Project Animation](dist/project-animations/another-great-project-animation.svg)
```

Alternatively, you could arrange them in a table for a more compact view, though this is a bit more complex to set up:

```markdown
| Project Showcase | Animation |
|---|---|
| **My First App** | ![My First App Animation](dist/project-animations/my-first-app-animation.svg) |
| **Awesome Library** | ![Awesome Library Animation](dist/project-animations/awesome-library-animation.svg) |
| **Data Visualizer** | ![Data Visualizer Animation](dist/project-animations/data-visualizer-animation.svg) |
```

---
*Remember: The SVGs are generated when the "Generate Project Animations" workflow runs (e.g., daily or when manually triggered). If you've just added a new project, you might need to run this workflow from the 'Actions' tab of your GitHub repository for its animation to appear in the `dist/project-animations/` directory.*
